# Personal Finance Tracker

## Streamline Your Budgeting and Spending

**What will the application do?**

My idea for this term project is a **personal finance tracker**! The finance tracker will make it easy for not just me, but anyone to have a streamlined and intuitive way in which their spending can be kept track of. Some early feature ideas of mine are:

- Input transactions into the tracker with info, category, date, etc.
- A budgeting portion where users can see their spending contrasted with their budget amount
- Seeing trends in spending habits and more!

**Why I'm Interested in this Idea!**

This project idea came to me pretty quickly as I already maintain a budget spreadsheet of my own to track my work income, spending, and the like. Currently, my spreadsheet allows me to add transactions and categorize them into areas like:

- **Food**
- **Transportation** (e.g., Evo costs and Uber rides)
- **Miscellaneous** (for anything that doesn't have its own category)

As such, an opportunity to migrate this concept from my static Google spreadsheet into an interactive and eventually visual format throughout the term was a *no-brainer* to take. I sure know I need to wrangle my spending habits and know that plenty of other people feel the same way too!

**Who will use it?**

This project will be usable by **anyone** who wants to finally take charge of their spending and understand where their money goes while also knowing why. Finance should be an accessible and widely taught topic as it benefits absolutely everyone on the planet, whether big or small and this serves as a way for me to help out in that regard and possibly make something quite cool along the way.
